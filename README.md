## What is a CMS

A CMS (Content Management System) is a software engine written by PHP developers that allows you to manage a website (add content, modify menus, etc.) without knowing HTML or CSS.  
However, creating a website with a CMS requires a programmer, designer, and layout specialist, as well as financial investment.

## Types of CMS

There are various content management systems for different purposes: online stores, blogs, forums, etc.

## Examples of CMS

Popular CMS examples include:  
- Joomla  
- WordPress (for blogs)

CMS can be either paid or free.

## What you need to know to make websites

## PHP and JavaScript

### Types of Scripts

- **Client-side scripts** (JavaScript) — executed in the user’s browser to make pages more interactive and visually appealing.
